# migration_data_integration
Repo for code that integrates different types of bird migration season data. This code uses data from the USGS Bird Banding Lab, eBird Status and Trends, and Movebank. Anyone using this code is responsible for obtaining permission to use these data for their species of interest and adhering to any associated terms of use.

Note that the code is a few years old and that several R packages have evolved quickly in the interim (e.g., raster --> terra, ebirdst). Updated code will be added as it is developed.
